# [Project 1: House Sale Price Predictions](https://github.com/mitchellaldridge/House-Sale-Price-Prediction)

This is a project done through kaggle for one of their machine learning competitions where the goal is to predict house sale prices.

* The analysis is done in Python using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-Learn
* Showcases EDA and Data Cleaning
* Uses a Pipeline to impute the data
* Gets best score from many different regression techniques such as XGBoost, Lasso, Random Forest
* Selects best models from baseline search and preforms hyperparameter tuning for model improvement


# [Project 2: Predicting E-commerce Customer Reviews](https://github.com/mitchellaldridge/Predicting-Ecommerce-Customer-Reviews)

This project was done as a final project in my masters level machine learning course to predict customer reviews for an ecommerce website.

* The analysis is done in R using libraries such as Tidyverse and Caret
* Showcases EDA and Data Cleaning
* Uses Double Cross Validation to select the best honest prediction of the best model between Linear Regression and Random Forest
* Includes variable importance visualizations
* Includes a final report detailing every part of the machine learning process
