# Mitchell Aldridge Data Science Portfolio

## About Me
I am a masters student in Data Science at UW-Green Bay in my final 2 semesters. I have experience with Python, R, SQL, Spark, Excel and Tableau.

# [Project 1: House Sale Price Predictions](https://github.com/mitchellaldridge/House-Sale-Price-Prediction)

This is a project done through kaggle for one of their machine learning competitions where the goal is to predict house sale prices.

* The analysis is done in Python using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-Learn
* Performed EDA and Data Cleaning to prepare the data set for model training
* Used a Pipeline to impute missing data
* Gets best score from many different regression techniques such as XGBoost, Lasso, Random Forest
* Selects best models from baseline search and preforms hyperparameter tuning for model improvement


# [Project 2: Predicting E-commerce Customer Reviews](https://github.com/mitchellaldridge/Predicting-Ecommerce-Customer-Reviews)

This project was done as a final project in my masters level machine learning course to predict customer reviews for an ecommerce website.

* The analysis is done in R using libraries such as Tidyverse and Caret
* Performed EDA and Data cleaning to prepare the data set for model training
* Uses Double Cross Validation to select the best honest prediction of the best model between Linear Regression and Random Forest
* Includes variable importance visualizations
* Includes a final report detailing every part of the machine learning process


# [Project 3: Working with Big Data through PySpark and Scala](https://github.com/mitchellaldridge/PySpark-Scala-Steam-Review-Analysis)

This project showcases skills using Spark (Scala & PySpark) to answer questions in Big Data

* The work was originally done in Apache Zepellin using Scala
* A copy of the work is also available in PySpark, using a subsample of the dataset for usability through github
* This project showcases the power of big data tools such as Spark through languages Scala and PySpark
* The questions being answered can be found in the Q&A document, as well as the output from the full dataset


# [Project 4: Life Expectancy Trends from Healthcare Spending in Tableau](https://github.com/mitchellaldridge/Tableau-Dashboard-Healthcare)

This project was done to showcase how government spending on healthcare affects life expectancy globally

* Performed EDA and Data Cleaning in R
* Found future trends using linear regression
* Created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to allow users hands on visualizations
* The dashboard allows users to view different countries and regions and the differences in life expectancy and healthcare spending
